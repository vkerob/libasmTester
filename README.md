# Libasm tester

Create general tests to ensure that the mandatory functions are implemented correctly.


## Running Tests

To run the tests, clone the repository into yours and execute these commands in libasmTester:

```bash
  make m
```
## Support

If you encounter any issues during execution, check the tester's makefile and modify the path to your functions or the include in include/tester.h, which is currently "#include "../../include/libasm.h"".
